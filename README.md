  - Created a basic VFS, implementing file system abstraction layers, inode structures, and directory traversal logic.  
  - Integrated caching mechanisms to improve access times and system performance.  
- **Virtual Address Translation** *(C)*  
  - Developed a virtual memory system for translating virtual addresses into physical memory using paging techniques.  
  - Incorporated page replacement algorithms (e.g., FIFO, LRU) to manage memory efficiently.  


### **COMP2511: The Art of Software Design**
- **Satellite Controller** *(Java)*  
  - Built an OOP-based system to manage satellite functionality, employing interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance.  
  - Applied design patterns to ensure scalability and modularity.  
- **2D Dungeon Game** *(Java)*  
  - Refactored and extended an existing game using OOP patterns such as State, Strategy, and Factory to enhance functionality.
